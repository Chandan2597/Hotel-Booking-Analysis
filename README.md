Hotel Booking Analysis <br>
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing booking information for two types of hotels: a city hotel and a resort hotel. The dataset comprises 119,390 rows and 32 columns, providing a comprehensive view of the hotel booking trends and patterns. The analysis is divided into three key phases: Data Collection and Description, Data Wrangling, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

1. Data Collection and Description <br>
The initial phase of the analysis involved a detailed examination of the dataset. Key Python functions such as head(), tail(), info(), columns(), and describe() were utilized to gain a preliminary understanding of the data structure, including the distribution of values across different columns. This step also included the renaming of certain columns to improve clarity and consistency, as well as an assessment of unique values and data types across all features.

2. Data Wrangling <br>
In the data wrangling phase, the dataset was meticulously cleaned to ensure it was well-prepared for analysis. Duplicate values were identified and removed to avoid skewed results. Unnecessary columns that did not contribute meaningfully to the analysis were dropped. A significant focus was placed on handling missing values, which were filled with appropriate replacements to maintain data integrity without compromising the dataset. This careful treatment allowed us to achieve a dataset with zero missing values, ensuring the retention of all relevant features for a more robust analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <br>
With the cleaned and well-structured dataset, the EDA phase will involve in-depth analysis to uncover trends, correlations, and insights within the data. This phase aims to provide valuable insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, and other key metrics that can inform decision-making and strategic planning for the hotels.

Various charts are employed in data visualization to gain deeper insights and achieve business objectives more effectively.

This structured approach ensures that the dataset is thoroughly prepared and analyzed, leading to actionable insights and informed decisions.

**Problem Statement:** <br>
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.
